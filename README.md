# System_Analysys_and_design
•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is one of our clients, and they want to take advantage of a void in the market when it comes to training students for driving tests at their local motor and vehicle department (DMV). Based on Liam, Ian (personal communication, January 22nd ), Driverpass wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-road training to better prepare them for driving tests.
•	What did you do particularly well?
Identifying the majority of requirements (functional and non-functional) has allowed me each use case.
•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I will pick the entity-relationship diagram to review the association relationship between entities. Here, I need to re-read the use case and the data flow to see how the entities are related.
•	How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?

The interpretation of user needs and their incorporation into a program follow multiple steps depending on the models ( waterfall, V-model, iterative and incremental development). Users' needs constitute the requirements specification of the program. The requirement elicitation is crucial because users' requirements are the inputs that will deliver the expected outputs. They are identified during analysis through various methods such as interview, JAD, observation, and documentation (written procedures, business form, report ). The analysis phase continues with process modeling, which captures data flow using a data flow diagram or UML use case diagram. The analysis phase ends with data modeling using entity relationships where data are organized and ready to be used by the design phase. 



How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The design phase is built upon the earlier phases, which means :
	Understand the verification and validation of analysis models
	Understand the transition from analysis to design
	Understand the use of factoring, partition, collaborations, and layers
	Be able to create package diagrams

 Specifically, the design phase encompasses class and method design, data management and layers design, human and computer interaction layer design, and finally, physical architecture layer design.
